A real-time smart autonomous car equipped with ESP32-CAM, Arduino, servo and gear motors, and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance. The system uses YOLOv4-Tiny and OpenCV for object detection and classification. Designed to operate efficiently on limited hardware, this project integrates machine learning, computer vision, and embedded systems to enable the car to navigate and respond to its environment intelligently.

Key Features:

Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance

Object classification using YOLOv4-Tiny

Synchronized wheel control with Arduino and motor drivers

Integration of ESP32-CAM for live video streaming

Ultrasonic sensor for accurate distance measurement

Modular hardware-software architecture for easy upgrades

Technologies & Libraries:

Arduino IDE, Python

OpenCV, NumPy, urllib

YOLOv4-Tiny model

ESP32-CAM, L298N Motor Driver
